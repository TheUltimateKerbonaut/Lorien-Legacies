### How do I get legacies?
At the moment, upon joining a new world, each player has a chance to recieve any number of legacies. The likelihood of recieving legacies, as well as how many, can be changed in the mod's config.

### How do I use them?
Legacies have to be toggled to be used. By default, this is done with the left-alt key.

### How do I use my abilities?
Legacy abilities can be toggled with a similar selection wheel to the toggle menu. The default key for this is Z.
